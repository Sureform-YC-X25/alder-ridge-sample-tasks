A professional risk table may separately describe Helix as the largest gross revenue exposure; that distinction is not a contradiction.

Do not require a scripted sentence. If the summary displays a Q2 free-cash-flow, combined-stress EBITDA, post-mitigation EBITDA, or other verified headline amount, a materially wrong displayed amount makes this criterion unmet; correct directional prose cannot rescue that contradiction.",

The resulting current outlook need not be duplicated on slide 9 when it is clear on slide 7 and the final control row says the latest forecast ties.
